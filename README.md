# VR Sword Cutting Experience

![Demo](demo.gif)

This project is a virtual reality experience developed in Unreal Engine for the Oculus Quest 2. It allows users to immerse themselves in a VR environment where their right hand transforms into a sword. The sword can be controlled using gesture recognition, enabling the user to cut objects within the virtual world. Please note that OpenXR support needs to be enabled in developer mode to use this project. Additionally, the MetaXR plugin is required for optimal functionality.

**Note:** This project is currently in the early stages of development and will continue to be improved upon in future iterations.

## Features
